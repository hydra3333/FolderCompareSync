## What is FolderCompareSync?

FolderCompareSync is a powerful, easy-to-use free tool that helps you **compare two folder trees side-by-side** and **synchronize files between them** with **reasonable performance**.
Think of it as a folder tree "bulk choose, copy and paste differences" with overwrite that shows you exactly what's different and lets you choose what to copy with **ease and reliability**.

## üîß Advanced Features with Performance Enhancements

### **Enhanced Copy Strategies**
The application automatically selects the optimal copy method for maximum performance:

#### **Enhanced Direct Strategy** (Small files < 10MB on local drives)
- Near-instant copying with complete timestamp preservation
- Perfect for documents, images, and small files
- Uses optimized `shutil.copy2` with enhanced metadata handling

#### **Optimized Staged Strategy** (Large files ‚â• 10MB or network drives)
- 50% performance improvement over traditional method
- Uses atomic rename operations instead of expensive copy-for-backup
- Maximum 2 files during operation vs traditional 3-file approaches
- Complete rollback capability with timestamp restoration

### **Wildcard Filtering Examples**
- `*.jpg` - All JPEG images
- `*2024*` - All files with "2024" in the name
- `backup_*.zip` - All backup ZIP files
- `IMG_*.png` - All PNG files starting with "IMG_"

### **Enhanced File Comparison Options can be combined**
- **Existence**: Files that exist in one folder but not the other
- **Size**: Files with different sizes
- **Date Created**: Files with different creation dates (enhanced preservation)
- **Date Modified**: Files with different modification dates (enhanced preservation)
- **SHA512**: **the gold standard** Files with different content (cryptographic hash comparison with performance optimization)

### **Smart Selection with Performance Context**
- **Individual files**: Click checkboxes next to specific files
- **Smart folder selection**: Click a folder to select only the different files inside it
- **Bulk selection**: "Select All Differences" buttons for quick selection with strategy preview
- **Clear selection**: "Clear All" buttons to start fresh
