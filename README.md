## What is FolderCompareSync?

FolderCompareSync is a powerful, easy-to-use tool that helps you **compare two folders side-by-side** and **synchronize files between them**. Think of it as a professional version of "copy and paste" that shows you exactly what's different and lets you choose what to copy.

### üéØ Perfect for:
- **Backup verification** - Make sure your backups are complete and up-to-date
- **Project synchronization** - Keep development folders in sync across different locations
- **Data migration** - Safely move files between drives or computers
- **Cleanup operations** - Find duplicate or outdated files
- **Archive management** - Organize and maintain file collections

## üí° Common Use Cases

### üìÅ **Backup Verification**
```
Left Folder:  C:\Important Documents\
Right Folder: D:\Backup\Important Documents\
Goal: Verify backup is complete and up-to-date
```
1. Compare both folders
2. Check files marked as "Different" or "Missing"
3. Copy missing or newer files to your backup

### üîÑ **Project Synchronization**
```
Left Folder:  C:\Projects\MyApp\
Right Folder: E:\ProjectBackups\MyApp\
Goal: Keep development and backup in sync
```
1. Use date comparison to find recently modified files
2. Filter by file type (e.g., `*.py` for Python files)
3. Copy newer files to keep everything synchronized

### üßπ **Cleanup & Organization**
```
Left Folder:  C:\Downloads\
Right Folder: C:\Organized Files\
Goal: Organize downloaded files
```
1. Filter by file type (`*.pdf`, `*.jpg`, etc.)
2. Review files before moving
3. Copy organized files to appropriate folders

### **Comparison Options**
- **Existence**: Files that exist in one folder but not the other
- **Size**: Files with different sizes
- **Date Created**: Files with different creation dates
- **Date Modified**: Files with different modification dates
- **SHA512**: Files with different content (cryptographic hash comparison)

### **Smart Selection**

## üìã Tips & Best Practices

### ‚úÖ **Before You Start**
- **Test with small folders first** to get familiar with the interface
- **Always preview** what will be copied before confirming operations
- **Check available disk space** before large copy operations
- **Close other programs** when working with very large folders

### ‚ö° **Performance Tips**
- **Use SHA512 comparison sparingly** - it's thorough but slower for large files
- **Filter large folders** to focus on specific file types
- **Enable Overwrite Mode** if you want to replace existing files
- **Watch the status log** to monitor progress and catch any issues

### üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Features**
- **Preview dialogs** show exactly what will be copied
- **Confirmation prompts** prevent accidental operations
- **Error handling** continues operation even if individual files fail
- **Status logging** provides complete record of all operations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Program won't start:**
- Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed
- Try running from Command Prompt: `python FolderCompareSync.py`

**Comparison is slow:**
- Disable SHA512 comparison for faster results
- Use filtering to focus on specific files
- Check available RAM if working with very large folders

**Copy operation fails:**
- Check file permissions and disk space
- Ensure destination folder is writable
- Review the status log for specific error messages

**Missing files in tree:**
- Check if files are hidden or system files
- Verify folder permissions
- Look for error messages in the status log

### **Getting Help**
- Check the **status log window** for detailed information about operations
- Enable **debug mode** for more detailed logging
- Review **error messages** for specific guidance on resolving issues
