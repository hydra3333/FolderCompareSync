Answers below.

1. **Strategy Selection Logic**: The spec mentions 2GB threshold for DIRECT vs STAGED. Should this be configurable, and should cloud storage detection (OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.) always force STAGED regardless of file size?
Cloud storage is to be treated per the table in section 5.1  i.e. always staged regardless of size.

2. **Verification Radio Buttons Location**: Where exactly in the FolderCompareSync UI should the three verification radio buttons be placed? Near the copy buttons, or in the comparison options section?
Since the choice is directly related to a copy action, place them near the near the copy buttons.

3. **BLAKE3 Dependency**: Should I assume BLAKE3 library will be available, or implement the SHA-256 fallback as the primary with BLAKE3 as optional enhancement?
Section 5.3 states that blake3 is the primary, so lets stick with that.

4. **Progress Dialog Enhancement**: Should the existing ProgressDialog_class be enhanced to show separate progress for copy phase vs verification phase, or create a new dual-progress dialog?
I think create a new clearly named dual-progress dialog dedicated to copying and verifying, perhaps if possible within the ProgressDialog_class.

5. **Backward Compatibility**: The current FileCopyManager has `copy_file(src, dst, overwrite=True)` - should I maintain this signature but ignore the overwrite parameter, or change it to `copy_file(src, dst)` since overwrite is deprecated?
Goal G.7 states "Existing overwrite functionality must be deprecated and removed" so lets change the sigature

6. **Debug Logging Level**: For the "commented-out debug statements in tight loops" - should these be conditional based on a debug flag, or literally commented out in the source?
Literally commented out in the source, perhaps also having a commented-out IF conditional based on a debug flag with it

Proceed with Coding? The implementation will prioritize safety (secure rollback), performance (intelligent strategy selection), and maintainability (comprehensive commenting and error handling) as specified.
Yes pleae proceed now.
